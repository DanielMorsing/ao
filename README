AO

ao is an acme program for querying the go oracle tool. When run, ao will start
a new window with a menu of queries to be run on the invoking window. A query
can be executed by using the middle button. ao will then use the selection
as an argument to the oracle tool.

If ao is run without arguments, the file of the invoking window will be used
as scope. If an ao instance is already running, it will be switched to the
new invoking window. An ao instance will exit once its window has been closed.
