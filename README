AO

ao is an acme program for querying the go oracle tool. When run, ao will start
a new window with a menu of queries to be run on the invoking window. A query
can be executed by using the middle button. ao will then use the selection
as an argument to the oracle tool. Right clicking on a file name will change
the window that the oracle is run on.

If ao is run without arguments, the file of the invoking window will be used
as scope. An ao instance will exit once its window has been closed.
